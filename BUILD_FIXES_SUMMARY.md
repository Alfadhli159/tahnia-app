# Build Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Critical Syntax Errors
- **Fixed `lib/core/utils/performance_utils.dart`**: Recreated the file with proper syntax to resolve compilation errors.

### 2. Analysis Options Cleanup
- **Removed deprecated lint rules** from `analysis_options.yaml`:
  - `avoid_returning_null_for_future` (removed in Dart 3.3.0)
  - `invariant_booleans` (removed in Dart 3.0.0)
  - `iterable_contains_unrelated_type` (removed in Dart 3.3.0)
  - `list_remove_unrelated_type` (removed in Dart 3.3.0)
  - `map_entry_of_different_types` (not recognized)
  - `prefer_equal_for_default_values` (removed in Dart 3.0.0)

### 3. Dependency Issues
- **Removed duplicate dev dependencies** from `pubspec.yaml`:
  - `flutter_launcher_icons` (was listed in both dependencies and dev_dependencies)
  - `flutter_native_splash` (was listed in both dependencies and dev_dependencies)

### 4. Code Quality Fixes
- **Fixed `@mustCallSuper` warning** in `hierarchical_message_selector.dart`: Added `super.build(context)` call in the build method.
- **Removed unused imports** in several files:
  - `lib/core/widgets/optimized_list.dart`: Removed unnecessary `flutter/rendering.dart` import
  - `lib/core/utils/cache_manager.dart`: Removed unused `flutter/foundation.dart` and `flutter/material.dart` imports

## Build Helper Scripts Created

### For Unix/Linux/macOS: `build_helper.sh`
```bash
chmod +x build_helper.sh
./build_helper.sh clean    # Clean and rebuild
./build_helper.sh fix      # Fix common issues
./build_helper.sh analyze  # Run analysis
```

### For Windows: `build_helper.bat`
```cmd
build_helper.bat clean    # Clean and rebuild
build_helper.bat fix      # Fix common issues
build_helper.bat analyze  # Run analysis
```

## Kotlin Daemon Issues

The Kotlin daemon connection errors are typically caused by:
1. **Memory constraints**: Already addressed with 8GB heap in `gradle.properties`
2. **Conflicting processes**: Use the build helper scripts to stop daemons
3. **Cache corruption**: Use the "fix" command in build helper scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Run the build helper**: Use `build_helper.bat fix` (Windows) or `./build_helper.sh fix` (Unix) to clean caches and stop daemons.

2. **Clean build**: After fixing, run `build_helper.bat clean` or `./build_helper.sh clean` for a fresh build.

3. **Monitor remaining warnings**: Most remaining warnings are style-related and won't prevent building:
   - Unused variables and methods
   - Missing `const` constructors
   - Deprecated `withOpacity` usage (can be updated to `withValues`)
   - Import ordering

## Gradle Memory Configuration

The project is already configured with optimal memory settings in `android/gradle.properties`:
```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx8G -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=4G -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Update Flutter**: Ensure you're using the latest stable Flutter version
2. **Update dependencies**: Run `flutter pub upgrade` to get latest compatible versions
3. **IDE restart**: Restart your IDE after applying these fixes
4. **System restart**: If Kotlin daemon issues persist, restart your development machine

The critical compilation errors have been resolved. The remaining warnings are mostly style-related and won't prevent the app from building successfully.
